3. At the moment, I work as a logistician. I have no experience in the IT field. At the amateur level, I made up HTML code. Now my goal is to get the necessary skills to get a job as a frontend developer. Such qualities as *diligence, attentiveness, responsibility, and the ability to learn quickly* will help me achieve the desired results.
4. At the intermediate level I have **HTML**, **CSS**

      }
    }
    return sum;
